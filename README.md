# Dudu Sky Add-on
An extension of the SkyScene Add-on, where it achieves the effect of preventing background apps from dying by modifying memory management mechanisms (lmk, psi). And by improving background process management, it's possible to achieve a smoother and more energy-efficient system.

If you want an optimization that improves the kernel's memory management behavior, check out the [SkyScene Add-on](https://github.com/WeirdMidas/SkySceneAddon), it specifically handles this aspect, such as swapping, reclaim, and others.

### Features

#### LMKD-Side (Modern Solution / Android 11+)
- Texto, Texto, Texto

#### Old LMK-Side (Old Solution / Android 10-)
- Texto, Texto, Texto
  
## Requirement

- Compatible with ARM64 and standard ARM
- Magisk, KSU or Apatch, the most up-to-date version possible if you can
- Android 8 or higher. Not compatible with versions below 8
- You need at least 3GB of RAM to use it. Modern Android requires this as a minimum amount of RAM. However, it is still compatible with devices that have less RAM
- It is recommended to use an additional busybox module for situations where the module cannot use the busybox from Magisk or the ROM
- Depending on the ROM or kernel you are using on your device, you may experience compatibility issues if they are heavily modified

## Installation

- Install this module, restart your phone, and open `/sdcard/Android/lmk_conf.txt` after rebooting to modify how much swap you want LMKD to handle before it starts looking for kills, the wait time before killing or not, and other LMKD or Old LMK parameters (if available). This will take effect after rebooting.
- Simple LMK is currently not supported.
- Per-Process LMK is currently not supported.

### Suggestions for Complementary Modules

- [A1Memory](https://github.com/OneB1ank/A1Memory): A memory management module that implements an OEM-style memory management framework in the system server, allowing you to control certain parts of memory management more efficiently than modern Android. Exclusive to Android 8-14.

@Iamlooper -- For the magisk MMT Reborn template. Thanks to the template, I was able to replace the old qti-mem-opt template and keep all the features without extra additions! Also now the cpu usage of the module has reduced by 2%, little but useful
